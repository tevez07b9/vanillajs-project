## Introduction

This project demonstrates how Vanilla JS can be used to build efficient and highly performant applications without the need for complex build tools or modern frameworks. It serves as a hands-on example to better understand the fundamentals of JavaScript and explore how modern frontend libraries like React and Vue are built on top of these concepts.

## Features

- 🚀 **Client-Side Routing** - Smooth and fast routing between different pages without full page reloads using the History API.
- 🔄 **Reactive Programming with Proxies** - Efficient state management with JavaScript `Proxy` objects to observe and react to changes.
- 📦 **Custom Web Components** - Build reusable and encapsulated components using the Web Components API.
- 🔗 **API Services** - Seamless integration with external APIs to fetch and display dynamic data.
